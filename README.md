## ❓ ❗ What the hell is even this
Hey, welcome to my personal project! This is a repository of my first web app from which I showcase everything that I have, other than from any social media. What's with the unusual README design? Well, I try to make things presentable. Due to how I'm gonna be documenting mostly everything here in this case.

## 🤝 Contributing
-Contributions are welcome. But technically, contributions are accepted within the boundaries of the resources. Meaning, I do accept mostly related in the codebase. But if for instance, content needs to be changed, you could request a **Pull Request** to pertain what should be changed, along with the changes that you want. Or contact me directly by [twitter](https://twitter.com/@CodexLink).

Though, any opinionated thoughts that would lead to being biased should keep to ourselves, if for instance, you don't certainly agree to the things that I might say.
