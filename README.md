## What the hell is even this ❓ ❗ — 💁 Introduction

Hey, welcome to my personal project! This is a repository of my first web app from which I showcase everything that I have, other than from any social media. What's with the unusual README design? Well, I try to make things presentable. Due to how I'm gonna be documenting mostly everything here in this case.

## 📑 Table of Contents

README Content is Not Yet Finalized. Coming Soon...

## 🏩 🔥 Consumed Libraries

There are multiple libraries that is consumed by this Web App. I could have told you right now to check my [***Package.JSON***](https://github.com/CodexLink/codexlink.github.io/blob/worker-branch/package.json) to know which libraries have been consumed. But to make things a bit friendly, here are the following libraries along with their descriptions of the purpose of why I needed them.

### Production Dependencies

-

### Development Dependencies

-

### Optional Dependencies

### Gatsby Plugin Dependencies
