## 🤝 Contributing

- Contributions are always welcome. But technically, contributions are accepted within the boundaries of the resources. Meaning, I do accept contributions mostly related in the codebase. But if for instance, specific content needs to be changed, you could request a **Pull Request** to point what should be changed, along with the changes that you want. Or contact me directly by [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@CodexLink).

- Though, any opinionated thoughts that would lead to being biased at any point of the topic should keep to ourselves, if for instance, you don't certainly agree to the things that I might say.
